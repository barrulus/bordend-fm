## 2026-10-26 — Project kickoff

**Done**
- Surveyed the installed stack of Noctalia (wayland-client, EGL/GLESv2, harfbuzz/pango, toml++,
  Luau, fzy, wuffs, libwebp, libjxl; MIT) and Umbriel (wlroots 0.20, Lua 5.4; MIT).
- Drafted `docs/DESIGN.md`; created `docs/ROADMAP.md`, `docs/buglog.md`, this devlog, `README.md`
  and `.gitignore`.
- Initialized git (`main`, no remote), MIT license, `.editorconfig`; copied the quark++ style
  (`.clang-format`, `.clang-tidy`, `.clangd`, `scripts/format.sh`) with includes regrouped for `nordend/`.
- Toolchain: clang-format / clang-tidy 21.1.8 installed (`clang-tools-extra`); `.clang-format` parses.
  The default Void mirror (Helsinki, `repo-default`) timed out on HTTPS while ping and port 80 worked:
  switched to `repo-de` via `/etc/xbps.d/00-repository-main.conf`.

**Decisions**
- C++20, CMake, stack aligned with Noctalia.
- Finder-style column view (Miller columns) + grid.
- Server-side decorations.
- `nordend` color template proposed upstream to Noctalia as a PR.
- Future scripting in Luau.
- External editor (helix) moved to the end: not a must-have.
- Languages: code, comments, commits, README, buglog and devlog in English; DESIGN and ROADMAP in Italian.
- Claude is credited in the README as copilot, not listed as a commit co-author. `CLAUDE.md` stays
  out of the repository.

**Open**
- DESIGN approval (ROADMAP 0.1).
- How much toolkit code to take from Noctalia.
